# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm Thato Blessing Tlhalefang from Botswana.

Iâ€™m a curious, determined, and creative problem solver who loves turning ideas into real solutions. From a young age, I was fascinated by how technology works. My background in Computer Systems Engineering has helped me understand both the hardware and software sides of computing.

I enjoy learning new tools and languages, and Iâ€™m passionate about using tech to improve everyday life, especially in underserved communities.

Outside of tech, I enjoy volunteering, playing music, and exploring design and photography.

Letâ€™s build something impactful together!
